Personally, I believe the iPhone 17 is the most worthwhile option in the new series. Released on September 9, 2025, the iPhone 17 brings a significant balance between price and performance, much like the iPhone 13 did four years ago.

## Pros

There are three major improvements in this generation: the screen, the camera, and charging speed. For the first time, the standard iPhone features a 120Hz ProMotion display, the same as the Pro model, with a 6.3-inch panel and identical resolution.

The camera has also received major updates. The ultra-wide lens has been upgraded to 48MP, and four new functions—Center Stage for photos, ultra-stabilized video, Dual Capture, and Center Stage for video calls—are now available in the standard version, just like in the Pro model.

Charging speed has also improved. Both iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro now support up to 40W fast charging, reducing the gap between them.

## Cons

Still, some distinctions remain. The iPhone 17 uses the A19 chip, while the Pro models feature the A19 Pro. Moreover, the standard iPhone is limited to USB 2.0 transfer speed, while the Pro has supported USB 3 for several generations. For most users, though, cloud services or wireless transfers are far more practical than cable transfer.

## Conclusion

The iPhone 17 starts at `\$ 799`, while the Pro model begins at `\$ 1,099`. Considering that both devices share most of the same features, I find the iPhone 17 to be the better choice. Just as the iPhone 13 represented a leap from its predecessor, the iPhone 17 brings most of the improvements possible in this cycle. Unless you plan to wait for the iPhone 18 Pro, the iPhone 17 is the best option now.
