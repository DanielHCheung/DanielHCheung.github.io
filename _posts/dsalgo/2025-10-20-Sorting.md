I will give all examples in ascending order, just change the judgement clause when you need descending order.

## $O(n^2)$ sorting algorithms

### Selection Sort

The idea is, always select the smallest value in unsorted list, and insert it into the last position of sorted list. I call it "Head In Order First".

| Sorted           | Unsorted        |
|------------------|-----------------|
| []               | [7 4 8 2 5 3 9] |
| [2]              | [7 4 8 5 3 9]   |
| [2 3]            | [7 4 8 5 9]     |
| [2 3 4]          | [7 8 5 9]       |
| [2 3 4 5]        | [7 8 9]         |
| [2 3 4 5 7]      | [8 9]           |
| [2 3 4 5 7 8]    | [9]             |
| [2 3 4 5 7 8 9]  | []              |



### Insertion Sort

The idea is, always insert the first value in unsorted list into a proper position of sorted list. I call it "Part In Order First".

| Sorted           | Unsorted        |
|------------------|-----------------|
| []               | [7 4 8 2 5 3 9] |
| [7]              | [4 8 2 5 3 9]   |
| [4 7]            | [8 2 5 3 9]     |
| [4 7 8]          | [2 5 3 9]       |
| [2 4 7 8]        | [5 3 9]         |
| [2 4 5 7 8]      | [3 9]           |
| [2 3 4 5 7 8]    | [9]             |
| [2 3 4 5 7 8 9]  | []              |


### Bubble Sort

The idea is, always compare nearby two elements, and swap if necessary. For each loop, the first element may compare with the last one, so the tail is make sure the largest (as tail is always sorted) . I call it "Tail In Order First".

| Unsorted         | Sorted          |
|------------------|-----------------|
| [7 4 8 2 5 3 9]  | [             ] |
| [4 7 2 5 3 8]    | [9            ] |
| [4 2 5 3 7]      | [8 9          ] |
| [2 4 3 5]        | [7 8 9        ] |
| [2 3 4]          | [5 7 8 9      ] |
| [2 3]            | [4 5 7 8 9    ] |
| [2]              | [3 4 5 7 8 9  ] |
| []               | [2 3 4 5 7 8 9] |


## $O(n\log n)$ sorting algorithms


### Heap Sort

Heap sort uses heap as data structure, each time put a new value into the heap, the time cost of upheap is always $O(\log n)$. Then always delete min value from the heap, which is also $O(\log n)$ time cost for downheap.
