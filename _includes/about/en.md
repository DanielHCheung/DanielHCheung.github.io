## Simple Introduction
Welcome to Daniel's blog - Data.

Daniel is a first year graduate (MS's degree) student in Data Science, and his major for bachelor degree is Statistics.

## Professional Skills

Daniel likes computers, and some related technology. (Also see this in following parts)

Python was the most heavily used language, for him. It's not just for computing, modeling, but also for real programs like building a website in flask. He did complete most projects in Python (for data analysis and modeling).

Other programming languages are less preferred. Over 5 years ago, he learned very basic C++ and still remembers most of it now. He started to learn Java from August 2025 for advanced learning in data structures and algorithms.

Statistical programming is also the skill he mastered, proficient in MATLAB, followed by R, and SAS (least frequent). 

Database Skills: SQL Syntax; SQLite; MySQL. He also plans to learn Postgresql and hasn't start yet.


## My Special Interest

### Repairing Laptops

He mostly worked on software repair at a young age (about 14), like reinstalling operating systems (Windows XP and Windows 7 at that time). Then he turned to hardware three years later, cleaning the CPU fan and upgrading RAM and hard drive.

In 2023, he accidentally dropped his Redmi phone, and the screen no longer lit up. Fortunately, only the cable connecting the motherboard and the screen broke.

### Aircrafts

Daniel likes aircraft. The first aircraft he took was a Boeing 787 Dreamliner (787-8, reg. 9V-OFE) from Scoot Airlines. He also flew on the Airbus A320 most often.

The longest flight was on Airbus A330, and he really likes the 2-4-2 layout of the economy cabin. 

He wishes to take Airbus A350 one day, with cutting-edge technology like Boeing 787 Dreamliner. 

Airlines he would like to take in the future: (higher priority, and not taken before)
